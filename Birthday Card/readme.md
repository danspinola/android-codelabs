[Codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-birthday-card-app#0)

What I learnt:

- What are user interface elements, such as `Views` and `ViewGroups`.
- How to display text in a `TextView` in an app.
- How to set attributes, such as text, font, and margin on a `TextView`.
